# testimonial-cards

A responsive testimonial-cards component built with **HTML5** and **CSS3**.  
It uses **Flexbox** for layout, adapts to different screen sizes with media queries,  
and demonstrates clean and beginner-friendly UI design.

## ✨ Features
- Responsive design (desktop → row, mobile → column)
- Built with Flexbox (`flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`)
- Simple, clean, and easy to customize
- No frameworks, just pure HTML & CSS

## 🛠️ Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)

## 📱 Responsiveness
- **Large screens** → Cards appear side by side
- **Small screens** → Cards stack vertically for readability


## 💡 Learning Outcomes
This project helped me practice:
- Understanding and applying Flexbox (`flex: 1 1 250px`)
- Debugging responsive issues at smaller breakpoints
- Building neat layouts with only HTML & CSS
